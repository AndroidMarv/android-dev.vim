# Android Development for Vim

[Vim](http://www.vim.org) is a kickass text editor turned IDE (with the right plug-ins). 
[Android](http://www.android.com) is an awesome mobile operating system that's 
open and plainly rocks. *Why not put these two together?*

`android-dev.vim` is a Vim plugin that allows you to easily build your Android 
application on the command line and within Vim.

## Installing
I recommending using [Vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to install 
plugins. The line necessary to add this plugin is as follows:

```viml
Bundle 'jalcine/android-dev.vim'
```

## Options
Extensibility is what we love and one of the more popular philosophies out 
there. The following are a list of recommended options to be set after 
installing this plugin.
